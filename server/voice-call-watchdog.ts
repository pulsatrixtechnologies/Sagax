// A call turn is never left without an answer
// (docs/voice-mode-xai.md, "A live call, like a phone").
//
// On a phone, silence after a question is a failure the person cannot see
// the reason for. A turn can end with nothing said: words that joined a
// turn as it was ending, a turn stopped by a barge-in whose words then
// waited, an engine error, a turn whose only output was tool calls. When a
// direct turn settles on a thread that is on a live call, the harness looks
// at the thread a moment later: if the person's newest words on the call
// have no written answer after them, nothing else is on its way (no turn,
// no queued words, no open question), and they were not already retried,
// the turn runs again for them once, told to answer briefly or ask.
