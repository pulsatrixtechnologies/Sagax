// Parallel tasks (shared/parallel-tasks.ts): the server's pure helpers.
//
// A person who sends a message while the bot is busy can ask for it to run
// as its own task. The task is a thread of the same bot linked to the
// conversation (TaskRecord.parallelOf); index.ts creates it, starts or
// queues its first turn and, when that turn settles, posts the result back
// into the conversation as a reply to the request. What lives here is the
// part that needs no server state: the task's brief, its title, its working
// folder, the per-person limit and the result line.
