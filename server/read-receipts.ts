// Read receipts: who has seen a message, people and bots alike.
//
// Each thread keeps one read position per participant, `readUpTo[id] =
// { messageId, at }`, in its own small table beside the transcript
// (server/message-db.ts `thread_reads`; a thread without rows has no
// receipts, so nothing to migrate). A position only moves forward.
//
// - A person's position moves when their app shows the message on screen
//   (POST /api/threads/<id>/read, sent by a focused window only). Their id
//   is their principal id.
// - A bot's position moves when its turn consumed the message: the message
//   was in the prompt or context its engine received, decided where the
//   server builds that prompt. A bot that only got a summary has not seen
//   it. Its id is `bot:<botId>`.
// - A peer bot reached through ask_bot keeps its delivery receipt
//   (server/peer-delivery.ts); this is separate.
//
// Privacy: in a conversation between two people (peopleDm), a person who
// turned off "Send read receipts" (preference `sagax.readReceipts.v1` =
// "off") shows nobody their position and sees nobody's, like iMessage.
// Rooms always show (their members chose to be there); bots always report.
// Positions are never written to the chat, the canonical event log or the
// admin audit.
