// Private conversations with a bot on an organization server.
//
// JC: "When talking to a shared bot, we should not be able to use the same
// thread. Being multiple in the same chat should be reserved for group
// chats." So every thread of a bot (a task, a 1:1 conversation) belongs to
// one person, its owner principal:
//
//   - the person who started it (a signed-in session);
//   - for a thread a bot opened while working on someone's request, the
//     owner of the thread that request came from;
//   - for a routine's thread, the person the routine runs as (runAs), else
//     the bot owner;
//   - for anything else (the bot's first thread, a webhook, a peer bot's
//     pair conversation, a record from before this rule), the bot owner.
//
// Only that person reads, posts, streams, searches, exports, answers cards
// in and fetches the files of that thread, and only while they still hold
// bot.use. Sharing a bot (grants, teams, a section) lets each person talk to
// it in their own threads; it never opens anyone else's. Edit and manage
// change the bot's settings, never its conversations. Organization admins
// and team managers get no exception (spec section 3, T7: an admin never
// reads a private Direct without a right; JC: a manager never reads a Direct
// unasked); they see audit metadata only.
//
// Group chats (rooms: their people and their bots) are the only
// conversations several people share: room threads are judged by the room
// (server/authz.ts canInChannel), never here.
//
// The operator at this computer (loopback, no viewer) sees everything, as
// everywhere in server/authz.ts. A solo server never calls this.
//
// Pure: no store, no request. server/index.ts supplies the records.
