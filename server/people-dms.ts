// Direct conversations between two people of an organization.
//
// A person-to-person conversation is a group record with `peopleDm: true`,
// exactly two `humanIds` (principal ids) and no bot. It reuses the group's
// thread, messages, live frames and unread flag, and nothing else:
//
// - Only its two people read it, list it, stream it, search it or export it.
//   No organization admin, no team, no section and not the operator at the
//   server's console (loopback): a private conversation stays private.
// - It stays people-only. No bot can be added, so nothing said there can
//   reach a bot's context, memory or its owner. Inviting a bot would need
//   both people to agree, and the first such bot would carry the transcript
//   to its own owner; a group chat already is the place for that.
// - Its people, name, section, folder and instructions never change, and it
//   has no shared memory (server/group-memory.ts). Unread and the home pin
//   are display flags, the same ones a member already sets on a room.
// - A message is a person's message: it starts no turn, marks the
//   conversation unread and notifies the other person only.
// - Threads (2026-10-09): it has threads like a bot, through the room task
//   routes (create, switch, rename, pin, archive, snooze, folder, delete) and
//   the room folder routes. A thread belongs to the pair: both see the same
//   list, titles, pins, folders, archive and snooze. Which thread each one
//   has open is theirs (an in-memory selection, like a bot's on an
//   organization server), and so is unread, per thread (`unreadFor`).
//   The stored `threadId` stays the default thread, so a client from before
//   threads (0.4.16) keeps reading and writing that one conversation.
//   Only a request that says it knows threads (the header below) is answered
//   with its own selection; a live frame always carries the default thread,
//   and such a client keeps the thread it has open. The thread from before
//   threads is titled "General" by the migration (`general: true`).
