// The reasoning effort of a voice call turn (docs/voice-mode-xai.md,
// "Latency"): on a call the person waits in silence for the first word, so
// a call turn (and the warm that prepares its process) runs at the lowest
// effort the engine offers, "low" where it exists. "none" is not picked on
// its own: it turns reasoning off, which is a different answer, not a
// faster one. A bot already set below that keeps its own level.
//
// TODO(#153): the model tier for a call (a faster model, not only a lower
// effort) belongs to the Auto mode of PR #153; only the effort changes here.
