// point, the end of the tool call it is running, and the queue starts a turn
// with the new message right away; the engine's session keeps its context.

// Pure bookkeeping, no IO: index.ts says when a tool starts and ends, and
// owns the interrupt. A tool that runs past the ceiling is cut there, so the
