// A person tagged with @ in a room hears about it the way a direct message
// reaches them (server/index.ts sendPeopleDmMessage): one `notify` frame of
// kind "message" whose `audience` is the people tagged, with the room and
// the thread as its target. Everything after is the direct message's path:
// the stream delivers it to that audience only (scopeChannelApproval), the
// desktop shows it with the person's own Settings > Notifications (sound,
// sticky, Dock bounce; src/lib/attention.ts), a click opens the room's
// thread (src/state/store.tsx openNotificationTarget), and the phone gets an
// APNs push when no open client of theirs saw the room in time
// (server/push/decide.ts).
//
// A room message that tags nobody keeps the room's rules: no notification
// for the people in it. A conversation between two people is not handled
// here (it notifies the other person on every message).
