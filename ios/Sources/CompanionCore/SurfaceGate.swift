// 2026-10-02-ipad-desktop-parity-design.md, "Rule for the iPad"): paired
// through a desktop's sidecar, the app shows what the remote-client renderer
// shows; paired with a server, what the served renderer shows for the
// session's scope (client: `CLIENT_ALLOW` in server/request-auth.ts; admin:
// everything). JC's decisions of 2026-10-03 (matrix, "JC's answers") add to
// that: D1 the advanced bot panel on a sidecar for the owner, D2 message pin
// everywhere, D3 room memory on the sidecar, D4 the phone's own extras (pin
// bot, delete bot, framing) for the owner or an admin.
//
// A feature the gate refuses is hidden, never drawn disabled: a button the
// computer can only answer 403 to is worse than no button.
