// Threads in a conversation between two people, like a bot's (desktop #262,
// AGENTS.md "Conversations with a person have threads like a bot",
// server/people-dms.ts, src/state/store.tsx `personThreadKept` and
// `peopleDmReadTarget`). The pair shares the list, titles, pins, archive and
// snooze; the open thread and unread are each person's own.
//
// The server answers a client that knows threads only when it sends
// `x-sagax-person-threads: 1` (`CompanionClient.makeRequest` sends it on
// every request, as the desktop's `api()` does): its own open thread in
// `threadId` and the whole list in `tasks`. A live `group` frame always
// names the default thread, so the phone keeps the one it has open.
