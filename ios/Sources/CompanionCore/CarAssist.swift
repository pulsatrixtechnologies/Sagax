// Sagax in the car (docs/ios-carplay.md): Siri reaches a bot by its name
// (a call or a message), a CallKit call carries the bot in its handle, and
// the CarPlay screen lists the recent bots and shows the call's state.
// Everything here is the decision, not the drawing: the app wires it to
// Intents, CallKit and CarPlay (App/CarAssist), and `swift test` covers it.
//
// Apple's CarPlay rules this follows (CarPlay Developer Guide, October 2026):
// never show a message's content on the car's screen, never ask the person
// to pick up the iPhone, voice first, short answers.
