# TestFlight and App Store release

The app is native Swift and uses XcodeGen; EAS commands do not apply.

## One-time Apple setup

1. Enrol in the Apple Developer Program.
2. Team Pulsatrix Technologies (`PP546MZVHZ`). The bundle IDs `ca.pulsatrix.sagax`, `ca.pulsatrix.sagax.widgets`, `ca.pulsatrix.sagax.share`, and `ca.pulsatrix.sagax.notification` are registered (ASC app id 6818532985). The app ID needs the Push Notifications and Communication Notifications capabilities (`docs/ios-push.md`).
3. App Group `group.ca.pulsatrix.sagax` on the app and its three extensions (widgets, share, notification service); the shared Keychain group is `$(AppIdentifierPrefix)group.ca.pulsatrix.sagax`, plus the app's own `$(AppIdentifierPrefix)ca.pulsatrix.sagax`. Keychain service names and the credential encryption label keep their `openmausbot` spellings on purpose.
4. The App Store Connect app is **Sagax**, primary category **Productivity**, and a unique SKU.
5. Automatic signing (`project.yml`): archive with `-allowProvisioningUpdates` and the App Store Connect API key so profiles exist for the containing app and its three extensions.
6. Add the review contact details in App Store Connect; do not commit private contact data or App Store Connect keys.

## Before every upload

1. Run `swift test` from `ios/` and the repository test suite.
2. Generate the Xcode project with `xcodegen generate` from `ios/`.
3. `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` is already `PP546MZVHZ` in `project.yml`; check it survived the generation.
4. Increment `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` for every upload. `MARKETING_VERSION` is always the same as the desktop `forkVersion` in `package.json`: every Sagax release bumps both to the same number (rule set by JC on 2026-10-09; 0.4.16 is the first release under it). Never leave iOS on an older version than the desktop app.
5. Archive a generic iOS device build and validate it in Xcode Organizer.
6. Upload to App Store Connect and distribute to internal TestFlight testers first.
7. Complete a real-iPhone pass for organization sign-in, QR pairing, Bonjour permission, Keychain restore and upgrade migration, Tailscale, push notifications, voice calls (CallKit, barge-in, network change), dictation, widgets, approvals, secure credential entry through Apple Passwords and by paste, background/foreground reconciliation, sign-out/revocation, transcript sharing, and Share-sheet delivery of text, a link, an image, and a document. Repeat Share-sheet delivery after force-quitting the containing app.
8. After internal testing, submit to the external TestFlight group before App Review (see External TestFlight below).

## App Store Connect

- Copy the localized text from `en-US/`. It still describes the old "OpenMausMobile" app and the hosted Cloudflare route: rewrite it before the first App Store (not TestFlight) submission.
- Use `privacy-answers.md` and verify it still matches the binary.
- Use `review-notes.md`, adding a real review contact and the demo access in App Store Connect.
- Support URL: `https://github.com/pulsatrixtechnologies/sagax/issues`
- Privacy policy URL: `https://github.com/pulsatrixtechnologies/sagax/blob/main/docs/ios-privacy.md`
- Choose manual release for the first App Store version; enable a phased release after the first production build is stable.

Uploads are done locally (`xcodebuild` archive and export, then upload with the App Store Connect API key); there is no TestFlight upload in CI.

## External TestFlight

The first external build goes through Apple's Beta App Review. Everything
for it lives in `testflight-beta.md`: the beta description and What to Test
in fr-CA and en-CA, the feedback email (`hello@pulsatrix.ca`), the URL
candidates, the review notes, the checklist (review contact, demo access,
build processed, export compliance) and the `asc` commands for app
`6818532985` and the group "Bêta Sagax". The final
`asc testflight review submit` runs only with JC's GO.
