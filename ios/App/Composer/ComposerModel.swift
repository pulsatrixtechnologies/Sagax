// The composer's power state (feature parity package WP3), one object per
// chat screen so the composer's views stay layout-agnostic (the iPhone
// composer today, the iPad composer pill later): failed sends kept for
// Retry, long pastes held as chips, the busy-send choice, Steer in flight,
// and what the "/" menu lists. Every field is keyed by thread, so switching
// threads in a chat never shows one thread's state in another.
