// APNs on this phone (docs/ios-push.md). iOS hands the app a device token
// after `registerForRemoteNotifications()`; the app gives it to the server
// it is signed in to (`POST /api/push/devices`) on every launch, when the
// token changes, when another server becomes the active one and when
// Settings > Notifications changes, and takes it back on sign-out. The
// server then pushes what the closed app would have missed: a message, a
// nudge, an approval, an achievement, a routine that failed.
