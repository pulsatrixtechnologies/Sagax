// The model providers (engines) offered to one person: the one answer every
// list of providers or models reads, on the server (GET /api/instances,
// GET /api/me/engines, the Primary Bot's team setup catalog) and in the app
// (the composer's model menu and window, New bot, a bot's backups and
// recovery, Settings > Models and voice, onboarding). 2026-10-18 : a
// provider the organization hid in Perspicax appears nowhere.
//
// - Solo server (no organization): every engine, nothing changes.
// - Organization server: an engine outside the organization's list
//   (`allowedEngines`, shared/org-allowed-engines.ts: null or absent is
//   every engine, [] is none since Sagax 0.5.12) is "notAllowed" and
//   dropped everywhere, even when the person connected it before.
// - 2026-10-30: what the admin turns off is off for everyone, the admin
//   included, even on the person's own subscription or key. The #1098
//   exception (2026-10-27) comes back only when the organization lets own
//   accounts through (`ownAccountsOutsideList`, off by default, set in
//   Perspicax): then an engine outside the list that the person pays for
//   with their own subscription or key (GET /api/me/engines `myTurns`
//   "subscription" or "key", never "expired") is offered, and the app says
//   "allowed through your own account" (`ownAccountOnly`). Until then it is
//   "notGiven" when the server lists it (`orgNotAllowed`), so Settings
//   shows it to connect their own account.
// - An engine the organization pays for but has not given this person
//   (`sagax_server_engines`, GET /api/me/engines `orgKeyNotGiven`) and that
//   nothing of their own serves is "notGiven": not offered to pick, still
//   listed in Settings, where the person can connect their own account.
