# Routine schedules

Ask a bot in ordinary language, for example:

> Prepare a report at 9 am on the first of every month, in Asia/Kolkata.

The bot turns calendar timing into a cron expression, and Sagax validates
it. The existing confirmation card shows the rule, its timezone and the next
three dates. Nothing is scheduled until you confirm. The scheduler wakes the
bot at the matching time; no model runs in the background to check the date.

In **Automations → Schedule**, choose **Monthly**, **Yearly**, or **Custom cron
(advanced)** in the existing routine editor. Monthly offers days 1–31 and
**Last day**. The timezone defaults to your browser's zone for a new preset and
can be changed. Saved cron routines retain their own zone even on another
computer. Editing just a title or instructions preserves the exact schedule.

## Advanced cron

Cron uses five fields: **minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week**.
An explicit IANA timezone such as `America/New_York`, `Asia/Kolkata`, or `UTC`
is required. Examples:

| Timing | Expression |
| --- | --- |
| First of each month at 09:00 | `0 9 1 * *` |
| Last day of each month at 09:00 | `0 9 L * *` |
| Second Monday of each month at 09:00 | `0 9 * * MON#2` |
| January 1 at 09:00 each year | `0 9 1 1 *` |
| Weekdays at 09:00 and 17:00 | `0 9,17 * * MON-FRI` |
| Every 15 minutes during weekday working hours | `*/15 9-16 * * MON-FRI` |

The app uses [Croner](https://github.com/Hexagon/croner) to calculate dates,
shared by the server and preview. It does not create a second timer service.
Lists, ranges, steps, `L`, `W`, and `#` follow that library's calendar semantics.
As with standard cron, restricting both day-of-month and day-of-week means
**either** field may match; leave one as `*` when you intend just the other.
Seconds, year fields, macros such as `@reboot`, shell commands, and arbitrary
code are not accepted. The finest resolution is one minute.

For elapsed-time repetition such as **every 90 minutes**, use the existing
interval schedule. Cron fields describe calendar positions: `*/90` in the
minutes field does not mean every 90 elapsed minutes. Holidays, external events,
and conditions such as "after a payment arrives" are not calendar expressions;
use an appropriate event/webhook workflow instead of a fake weekly schedule.

## Dates, clock changes and downtime

- Dates that do not exist are skipped: the 31st skips shorter months and
  February 29 runs in leap years. **Last day** handles every month.
- Daylight-saving gaps move the chosen wall-clock time forward through the
  gap. During a repeated hour, a matching clock time runs once, at its first
  occurrence. The preview uses the same calculation as execution.
- Routine execution defaults to **Bot’s current setup**: its selected model and
  configured computer, including a self-hosted VPS. No Boat key is needed for
  that VPS. **Boat cloud computer** is a separate, explicit choice: the bot's
  own model works on its Boat. The agent tools call these `run_on: "maus"` and
  `run_on: "box"`; legacy stored `runOn: "cloud"` still means Boat and is not
  migrated to a different runner.
- Sagax must be running to dispatch routines, including cloud-targeted
  routines. There is no external always-on scheduling service: the schedule
  runs inside the app on your computer — it is not Grok's or anyone's cloud —
  so a sleeping computer or a quit app runs nothing, and the app cannot wake
  a sleeping Mac. The desktop app does the one thing it can: while plugged
  in, it keeps the computer from idle-sleeping for the hour before a due
  routine and while one runs (Automations → *Keep this computer awake for
  routines*, on by default; a closed lid still sleeps). For true 24/7, run
  Sagax on a VPS — see [deploy-vps.md](deploy-vps.md).
- Existing catch-up policy remains: up to 12 hours late, one missed occurrence
  can be dispatched; older work receives a missed-run receipt. The next date
  advances without replaying every missed minute. Queued/running/waiting work
  for the same cron routine does not accumulate overlapping copies.
- Existing one-time, daily/weekday and interval schedules are not migrated or
  reinterpreted. Team exports retain cron expressions and zones; imports remain
  paused until enabled. Older phone apps safely treat cron as a newer schedule;
  use chat or the desktop/web editor for it, rather than converting it to daily.

Cron series are edited through the routine editor rather than calendar dragging,
which could otherwise ambiguously change an entire expression. Dense calendar
projections are bounded per day; Run logs remain the source of actual outcomes.

## Webhooks: always a bearer token

Webhooks are the way to start a routine-style task from an event outside the
app (a build finishing, a payment arriving) instead of faking a schedule. The
receiver listens on its own port (`SAGAX_WEBHOOK_PORT`, default the app port
plus one) and every webhook needs a bearer token; there is no unauthenticated
mode.

```sh
curl -X POST https://<your-host>/hooks/<endpoint-id> \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"task":"Check the failed build"}'
```

- The token is created with the webhook and shown **once** in the editor, with
  a copy button. Afterwards only its last 4 characters are shown. **Regenerate**
  asks for confirmation and the old token stops working immediately.
- The token is read only from the `Authorization` header. A token in the URL
  path, the query string or the body is refused with `401`, and so is a missing
  or wrong one. The answer never says which part was wrong.
- A source that fails authentication 10 times in a minute gets `429` until the
  minute has passed.
- Upgrading: a webhook created before this rule gets a new token when the
  server starts, and its old URL (the secret used to be part of the path) stops
  working. Open the webhook in the editor and copy the token once ("This
  webhook now needs a bearer token; copy it here"), then update each sender.
