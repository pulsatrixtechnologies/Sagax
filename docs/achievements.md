# Achievements: the Mastery tier (Maîtrise)

Achievements (`shared/achievements.ts`, catalog in `shared/achievements-catalog.ts`,
server store in `server/achievements.ts`) already teach the first habits:
send a message, create a routine, answer an approval. The Mastery tier is
the next step. Its 24 achievements are hard on purpose: each one proves real
mastery of working with AI and of Sagax, never a vanity count (no "send 500
messages"). They unlock the four Mastery characters (Shiba, Grump, Ogre,
Frog) and every one of their skins.

## The rules of the tier

- **Measured by the server only.** Every rule reads facts the server saw
  (a routine run that ended, an approval denied, a turn completed on a
  model). The app cannot post one: a client event of type `mastery` is
  refused like any server event.
- **Best value, never taken back.** A measure keeps the best value it ever
  reached (`shared/achievements-mastery.ts`), so a good stretch that ended
  still counts, and an unlock is forever.
- **Idempotent.** A fact that carries an id (a routine run, an approval, a
  delegation) counts once, however often it is replayed.
- **Harder than the rest.** 100 to 300 points (the other tiers stop at 100).
  The points count toward the points tiers (Bronze to Gold) like any others;
  Platinum ("every achievement that is not a secret") leaves Mastery aside.
- **Two weeks of real use for a character.** Each character's own
  achievement (100 points) is reachable in about two weeks of daily work;
  the named skins come on three harder rungs; the premium skins on the
  hardest achievements of the tier.
- **The points tiers moved.** Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum leave the
  old "mastery" category for their own, "Tiers" ("Paliers"); "Mastery"
  ("Maîtrise") is now this tier. Categories are not stored, so nothing
  migrates.

## The 24 achievements

Secret ones keep their name and rewards hidden until unlocked, with a hint.
Every Mastery achievement also gives a title (its own name).

Ferryman needs an organization server (a catalogue and colleagues). The
capstone asks for 20 of the 23 others, so a solo server can still reach it.

## The unlock map (`shared/mascot-unlocks.ts`)

The registry is the only place that names the Mastery characters. It
imports no art, so it holds before the characters land and after.

| Character | Character unlock | Named rung 1 | Named rung 2 | Named rung 3 | Retro 98, Gold | Neon | Chrome | Glitch | Holo, Molten |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `shiba` | `hands-off` | `second-wind` (cream, blacktan) | `common-thread` (red, sesame) | `quiet-nights` (white) | `pack-leader` | `ferryman` | `second-opinion` | `clean-slate` | `sagax-master` |
| `grump` | `reviewer` | `prompter` | `red-pen` | `not-so-fast` | `justice-of-peace` | `ferryman` | `second-opinion` | `clean-slate` | `sagax-master` |
| `ogre` | `conductor` | `ten-hands` | `plugged-in` | `swarm` | `full-house` | `ferryman` | `second-opinion` | `clean-slate` | `sagax-master` |
| `frog` | `polyglot` | `thrifty` (leaf, tree) | `translator` (poison, bullfrog) | `skill-smith` (ghost) | `total-recall` | `ferryman` | `second-opinion` | `clean-slate` | `sagax-master` |

- The base skin (`plain`, or `classic`) comes with the character.
- Named skins are spread over the three rungs in the order the character
  registers them (skin i of n falls on rung floor(3i/n)). A mascot branch
  registers its named skins by appending to `namedSkins` in its entry. A
  named skin not registered yet is locked behind the last rung, never free.
- `masteryUnlockFor(character, skin?)` names the achievement;
  `masteryLock(keys, character, skin?)` says whether it is locked for a
  person's reward keys; `masteryRewards(achievement)` lists what an
  achievement unlocks (the catalog's rewards come from it).
- An unlocked Mastery achievement adds the key `mastery:<id>` to the
  snapshot's `rewards`, so a skin registered later opens with it.

## How the server measures

`server/achievements-mastery.ts` turns what the server already sees into
facts for a person; `shared/achievements-mastery.ts` keeps the bounded state
and the measures. The hooks in `server/index.ts`:

| Where | Fact |
|---|---|
| `routine.run` frame (completed, failed, missed) | `routine.outcome` (with the routine's continuity) |
| PATCH `/api/routines/:id` | `routine.edited` |
| A new approval card in a thread (`message` frame) | `approval.requested` |
| The card answered allow or deny (`message.patch` frame) | `approval.answered`, with `write` from the tool's name or its MCP hints |
| `runtime` frames `turn.started` and `turn.completed` | `turn.started`, `turn.done` (model family; Auto and whether its pick was cheaper by list price) |
| Activity lines (`message` frames) | `tool.used`: a sub-agent, an integration (`mcp__<server>__...`, a Perspicax API), a skill loaded (`Skill`, `skill_view`) |
| A bot's final answer | `reply` (French or not) |
| POST `/api/bots/:id/messages` | `message.sent` (French or not, steered into the running turn or not) |
| POST `/api/bots/:id/interrupt` | `bot.stopped` |
| PATCH `/api/bots/:id`, `/profile`, SOUL file apply | `persona.saved` (when the standing instructions changed) |
| A delegation's receipt (`finalizeDelegationWatch`) | `delegation.done` (cross-model when the families differ) |
| `/api/internal/skills/stage` create from a conversation | `skill.learned` |
| PUT `/api/bots/:id/memory`, `/memory/file` | `memory.written` |
| Automatic recall with notes (`autoRecallPrompt`) | `memory.recalled` |
| POST `/api/bot-catalog/:id/import` | `catalog.imported` (for the publisher) |
| PATCH `/api/bots/:id/tasks/:threadId`, and the nightly pass | `threads.census` |

French is read from small words only (`looksFrench`): no model, no network.

**Nightly pass.** Once per person per local day (the person's `tzOffset`),
the server looks at their conversations (Ten Hands) and closes the windows
that span days (Quiet Nights and Clean Slate count finished days only;
Plugged In and Thrifty slide over seven days), then announces any unlock
with the usual frame and toast.

Also fixed on the way: an approval answered from a thread
(POST `/api/threads/:id/respond`) now counts for Gatekeeper and Trusted Judge.

## A locked look

- **Server.** PATCH `/api/bots/:id` and PATCH `/api/bots/:id/profile`
  refuse a `mascotLook` that puts on a Mastery character or skin the person
  has not unlocked: 403 `{ code: "look_locked", achievement, character,
  skin? }`. What a bot already wears is never taken back. Until a Mastery
  character lands, the look schema refuses it anyway (400).
- **Look editor.** A Mastery character or skin stays in the picker, locked:
  a padlock, the achievement's progress bar, and the hint "Unlock: Hands Off
  (7/10)" (a secret's hint for a secret achievement). The older characters
  keep hiding their locked skins as before.
- **Achievements modal.** The Mastery category (Maîtrise) shows every card
  with its progress bar from 0 and what it unlocks: the character or its
  skins, greyed until unlocked (a placeholder until the character's art
  registers in `src/components/achievements/mastery-art.tsx`). Unlocks use
  the same toast and chime as every achievement.
- **iOS.** The generated catalog carries the tier
  (`node ios/parity/achievements-catalog.mjs`); the achievements sheet lists
  Mastery and Tiers, shows the bar from 0 and "Locked: N looks to unlock".
  Parity row DC47.

## For the mascot branches

When a character lands (`feat/mascot-shiba`, `-grump`, `-ogre`, `-frog`):

1. Add its id to `MASCOT_CHARACTERS` and its skins as usual; keep its base
   skin `plain` (or `classic`) and the premium ids (`retro98`, `gold`,
   `neon`, `chrome`, `glitch`, `holo`, `molten`).
2. Append its named skins, easiest first, to its entry's `namedSkins` in
   `shared/mascot-unlocks.ts` (Shiba's are already there).
3. Register its art in `MASTERY_ART` (`src/components/achievements/mastery-art.tsx`).
4. Call `skinLock(unlocks, "<id>", skin)` and `characterLock(...)` in its
   picker (`MascotLookEditor.tsx`), as the other characters do: the lock,
   the hint and the progress come with them.
5. Run `node ios/parity/achievements-catalog.mjs` so the phone gets its names.
