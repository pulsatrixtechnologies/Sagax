# Seen by and reactions on messages

Status: 2026-10-09. Applies to a 1:1 with a bot, a room, and a conversation
between two people, on a solo server and an organization server alike.

## Seen by

Every thread keeps one read position per participant: `{ messageId, at }`
keyed by the person's principal id or `bot:<botId>`
(`server/read-receipts.ts`, table `thread_reads`). A person's position moves
when their focused app shows a message (`POST /api/threads/<t>/read`), a
bot's when its turn consumed the message. Positions only move forward and are
never written to the transcript.

Under a message, `SeenByRow` (`src/components/SeenBy.tsx`) shows:

- the muted label "Seen by" (fr "Vu par", pt-br "Visto por");
- the avatars of the people and bots who have read up to it, oldest first,
  stacked, five at most, then "+N";
- on hover or keyboard focus of an avatar, a tooltip with the name and the
  read time ("Zachary Sellam · 2:46 PM"); the same words are its aria-label.

Each reader appears once, under the last message they have seen that they
did not write. A room shows everyone; a 1:1 with a bot shows the bot until it
answers. The viewer is never shown. "Send read receipts" off still hides a
person both ways in a conversation between two people.

## Reactions

A message carries `reactions: [{ emoji, actors: [{ id, kind, name }], at }]`
(`shared/reactions.ts`): one entry per emoji, `kind` is `person` or `bot`,
`at` is when the emoji first landed (it orders the chips). Messages stored
with the older `{ emoji, by }` entries are read through `normalizeReactions`
and rewritten on their first change.

`POST /api/threads/<threadId>/messages/<messageId>/reactions` with
`{ emoji }` toggles the caller's own reaction (`mode: "add" | "remove"` is
accepted too). Rules:

- The caller is always the actor; a body naming someone else is ignored.
- Who may call it is who may read the thread: a hidden bot, thread or room
  is 404, a conversation between two people is the pair's only, a read-only
  room member may react.
- `emoji` must be one emoji sequence (400 `reaction_emoji`); only chat
  messages take one (400 `reaction_kind`); 24 distinct emojis per message at
  most (409 `reaction_full`).
- The change is a persisted message patch, sent live as `message.patch` to
  everyone who sees the thread. It is quiet: no notification, no unread.

In the app (`src/components/Reactions.tsx`): a smiley in the message's hover
bar opens a picker with 👍 ❤️ 😂 🎉 👀 🙏 ✅ ❌ and a search in a small
built-in emoji set (`src/lib/emoji-list.ts`); the "…" menu starts with "Add
reaction" (E). Chips under the message show the emoji and the count,
highlighted when the viewer reacted; a click toggles the viewer's own; hover
or focus lists who reacted, a bot with its mascot.

## Bot reactions

Bots get two agents tools (`server/drivers/agents-catalog.ts`):

- `react_to_message({ message_id?, emoji })`: `message_id` defaults to the
  message the bot is answering (the newest chat line someone else wrote in
  the turn's thread);
- `remove_reaction({ message_id?, emoji? })`: takes back the bot's own.

The harness route `/api/internal/reaction` records the bot as the actor
(`bot:<id>`, its name), refuses the bot's own messages (`reaction_own`),
keeps one reaction per bot per message (`reaction_one`; remove first to
change it), allows three adds per turn (`reaction_budget`), and writes no
message. The prompt guidance (`REACTION_PROMPT`): react when a short
acknowledgement is better than a message (👍 noted, ✅ done, 👀 looking),
at most one per message, never on its own messages, and end the turn without
text when the reaction says it all. A turn that only reacts writes no reply
bubble.
