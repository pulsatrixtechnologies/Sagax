// The live call's ears on the server: one WebSocket per call
// (GET /voice/listen) to xAI's streaming speech to text. The person's audio
// is sent while they speak (the turn detector decides when, so silence and
// room noise are never sent or billed), partial words come back as they are
// recognized, and `finish` asks xAI to finalize the utterance the moment the
// turn ends: the words are ready a few hundred milliseconds after the person
// stops, not after an upload. When the socket cannot open (an old server, a
// proxy without WebSockets), each turn is uploaded whole instead
// (POST /voice/transcribe), the call keeps working.
//
// Stability: a socket that drops (a Wi-Fi switch, a sleep, xAI ending its
// session) is reopened at once with a backoff (RECONNECT_BACKOFF_MS) and
// then every RECONNECT_EVERY_MS for the rest of the call; the next turn
// streams again. Only the utterances already finalized and still waiting for
// their words are uploaded whole; the one being spoken is sent again from
// its first frame on the new socket. The server says `reconnected` when it
// replaced xAI's side behind the same page socket: the same resync. An
// upload that fails is tried once more, then the turn reports `failed` so
// the call tells the person; a turn is never dropped silently.
