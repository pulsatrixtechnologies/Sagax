# Sagax agent notes

Before claiming a server or conversation change works, follow
[`docs/verification/README.md`](docs/verification/README.md). Always launch an
isolated fixture; never verify mutations against the user's live app or data.

## Where work goes

All work stays in `pulsatrixtechnologies` repositories. Never open a pull
request, issue, or push against the original OpenMausBot project
(`milind-soni/OpenMausBot`) or any other upstream. Push branches only to
`origin` (`pulsatrixtechnologies/pulsa-bot`) and target PRs at it. Pass
`--repo pulsatrixtechnologies/pulsa-bot` to `gh` so it never picks a parent
repository. Do not add an upstream remote with push access.

More specific `AGENTS.md` files override this note within their directories.

## Mail settings

Settings > Email (`src/components/MailSettings.tsx`, `server/mail-routes.ts`,
`server/mail-config.ts`, field ids in `shared/mail-settings.ts`) configures
the mail of a solo server. Keep these rules, each covered by a test in
`server/mail-routes.test.ts` or `server/mail-config.test.ts`:

- `GET /api/mail/settings` never returns a secret or any part of one: a
  password, API key or key secret is only `configured: true|false`.
- The routes are admin scope only (not in `CLIENT_ALLOW`) and answer 403
  `identity_perspicax` on an organization server.
- `POST /api/mail/test` takes no fields, sends only to the caller's own
  address and is rate limited.
- Saved values live in `config.json`'s `mail` block through `saveConfig`
  (never a generic `PUT /api/config` patch) and win over `OMB_MAIL_*`, which
  only provides defaults.
- A sender always has a name (default `Sagax`); Twilio refuses one without.
- Tests and fixtures use fake credentials only.

## Profile on an organization server

On an organization server (`OMB_IDENTITY=perspicax`) a signed-in person's
name and email belong to Perspicax. Keep these rules, each covered by a test
in `server/member-identity.e2e.test.ts`, `server/org-identity.e2e.test.ts`,
`server/org-profile.e2e.test.ts`, `server/oidc-login.test.ts` or the
onboarding tests:

- `GET /api/auth/session` and the config's `viewer` carry
  `profileManagedBy: "perspicax"` and `profileManageUrl` (the issuer's
  `/console/me`) for every session; never on a solo server or for the
  operator at the server's own console (loopback).
- `PUT`/`PATCH /api/config` with `profile.name` or `profile.email` answers
  403 `identity_perspicax` for those sessions. About me and the rest of the
  config stay as they were.
- The name and email come from the id_token and the directory and are
  refreshed at each sign-in and token refresh (`PrincipalRegistry.forSubject`).
- The UI follows the server's answer (`src/lib/profile-management.ts`): the
  welcome greeting asks for nothing and Settings > General shows the identity
  read-only ("Géré par votre organisation (Pulsatrix Perspicax)", "Modifier
  dans Perspicax"). A change here needs the server image redeployed.
- A person reads as `personDisplayName` (`server/viewer-identity.ts`): the
  Perspicax display name, else the address's local part, else the login; a
  directory name equal to the login is not a display name.
- Avatar (`server/org-profile.e2e.test.ts`): Sagax keeps only a version
  (`Principal.avatar`) from the id_token `picture` claim (a URL on the
  issuer's origin with `?v=<version>`) or the directory's `avatar`
  (null removes it), reads the PNG or JPEG through the link
  (`GET /api/v1/pulsabot/people/<sub>/avatar`, Bearer link token) and serves
  it at `/api/people/<principalId>/avatar?v=<version>`. Without those
  Perspicax fields everyone keeps their initials.

## Launch flow (desktop)

First run on the desktop app's own window opens the launch screen
(`src/components/onboarding/LaunchScreen.tsx`, rules in `src/lib/launch.ts`)
before the welcome tour: **No server** is the solo app, **Server**
probes the address (`orgJoin.probe`, Perspicax-linked servers only) then
`orgJoin.join` saves the server and starts the existing **Sign in with
Pulsatrix** (`electron/org-join.mjs`, `startPulsatrixSignIn` in
`electron/main.mjs`). Do not add another sign-in path. The choice lives in
`config.onboarding.launchMode`; the default address is
`DEFAULT_SERVER_ADDRESS`, overridable at build time with
`SAGAX_DEFAULT_SERVER`. The welcome tour no longer surfaces the inherited
managed-desktop Admin sign-in; Settings > Organization still does. See
`docs/self-hosting.md` ("At launch: No server or Server").

## Sign in with Pulsatrix (desktop)

The desktop app always signs in through the system browser, never in a
window of its own (passkeys and password managers live in the browser).
`startPulsatrixSignIn` in `electron/main.mjs` and
`electron/oidc-system-sign-in.cjs` own it; there is no in-app sign-in
window, do not add one back. Return paths, in order: a one-shot loopback
listener on `127.0.0.1` (ephemeral port, random state path, exact Host and
Origin, ten-minute timeout, closed after use), then `openmausbot://auth` only
when this exact running copy owns the scheme and the server advertises
`nativeReturn`, else an error on `/pair`. The server side is
`validLoopbackReturn` in `server/oidc-login.ts` (loopback IP literals with a
port and a state only; the credential rides in the fragment) and the
descriptor's `identity.loopbackReturn`. Tests:
`electron/oidc-system-sign-in.node-test.mjs`, `server/oidc-login.test.ts`,
`server/oidc-session.e2e.test.ts` (S2-7b). The return lands in the main window as
`<origin>/pair?signin=<nonce>#code=...` (`authReturnTarget`): never a
fragment-only change of the `/pair` the window already shows, which would
not reload the page. `scripts/verify-desktop-sign-in.ts` proves it in a real
Electron window. A change to that server code needs the server image
redeployed.
