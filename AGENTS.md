# Sagax agent notes

Before claiming a server or conversation change works, follow
[`docs/verification/README.md`](docs/verification/README.md). Always launch an
isolated fixture; never verify mutations against the user's live app or data.

## Where work goes

All work stays in `pulsatrixtechnologies` repositories. Never open a pull
request, issue, or push against the original OpenMausBot project
(`milind-soni/OpenMausBot`) or any other upstream. Push branches only to
`origin` (`pulsatrixtechnologies/pulsa-bot`) and target PRs at it. Pass
`--repo pulsatrixtechnologies/pulsa-bot` to `gh` so it never picks a parent
repository. Do not add an upstream remote with push access.

More specific `AGENTS.md` files override this note within their directories.

## Mail settings

Settings > Email (`src/components/MailSettings.tsx`, `server/mail-routes.ts`,
`server/mail-config.ts`, field ids in `shared/mail-settings.ts`) configures
the mail of a solo server. Keep these rules, each covered by a test in
`server/mail-routes.test.ts` or `server/mail-config.test.ts`:

- `GET /api/mail/settings` never returns a secret or any part of one: a
  password, API key or key secret is only `configured: true|false`.
- The routes are admin scope only (not in `CLIENT_ALLOW`) and answer 403
  `identity_perspicax` on an organization server.
- `POST /api/mail/test` takes no fields, sends only to the caller's own
  address and is rate limited.
- Saved values live in `config.json`'s `mail` block through `saveConfig`
  (never a generic `PUT /api/config` patch) and win over `OMB_MAIL_*`, which
  only provides defaults.
- A sender always has a name (default `Sagax`); Twilio refuses one without.
- Tests and fixtures use fake credentials only.

## Launch flow (desktop)

First run on the desktop app's own window opens the launch screen
(`src/components/onboarding/LaunchScreen.tsx`, rules in `src/lib/launch.ts`)
before the welcome tour: **No server** is the solo app, **Server**
probes the address (`orgJoin.probe`, Perspicax-linked servers only) then
`orgJoin.join` saves the server and starts the existing **Sign in with
Pulsatrix** (`electron/org-join.mjs`, `startPulsatrixSignIn` in
`electron/main.mjs`). Do not add another sign-in path. The choice lives in
`config.onboarding.launchMode`; the default address is
`DEFAULT_SERVER_ADDRESS`, overridable at build time with
`SAGAX_DEFAULT_SERVER`. The welcome tour no longer surfaces the inherited
managed-desktop Admin sign-in; Settings > Organization still does. See
`docs/self-hosting.md` ("At launch: No server or Server").

## Upstream sync

Last sync: 2026-10-01, upstream `milind-soni/OpenMausBot` main at
`4ed952aa` (0.1.92) merged into Sagax; `baseVersion` follows it. To repeat:

- Keep the `upstream` remote fetch-only (`git remote set-url --push
  upstream no_push`). Never push, open a pull request or file an issue
  upstream.
- `git fetch upstream`, branch from `origin/main`, then `git merge
  upstream/main` (a real merge, never a rebase) so history stays traceable.
- On conflict our behavior wins and upstream improvements are layered in.
  Merge `src/locales/*.json` and `source-hashes.json` as a union of keys and
  run `pnpm i18n:check`.
- Run `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, typecheck, lint, the unit suites and
  `pnpm build`; compare failures with `origin/main` before pushing to
  `origin` only.
- Upstream's own MCP sign-in is kept unwired in
  `server/mcp-oauth-upstream.ts`; `server/mcp-oauth.ts` is ours.
