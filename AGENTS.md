# Sagax agent notes

Before claiming a server or conversation change works, follow
[`docs/verification/README.md`](docs/verification/README.md). Always launch an
isolated fixture; never verify mutations against the user's live app or data.

## Where work goes

All work stays in `pulsatrixtechnologies` repositories. Never open a pull
request, issue, or push against the original OpenMausBot project
(`milind-soni/OpenMausBot`) or any other upstream. Push branches only to
`origin` (`pulsatrixtechnologies/pulsa-bot`) and target PRs at it. Pass
`--repo pulsatrixtechnologies/pulsa-bot` to `gh` so it never picks a parent
repository. Do not add an upstream remote with push access.

More specific `AGENTS.md` files override this note within their directories.

## Mail settings

Settings > Email (`src/components/MailSettings.tsx`, `server/mail-routes.ts`,
`server/mail-config.ts`, field ids in `shared/mail-settings.ts`) configures
the mail of a solo server. Keep these rules, each covered by a test in
`server/mail-routes.test.ts` or `server/mail-config.test.ts`:

- `GET /api/mail/settings` never returns a secret or any part of one: a
  password, API key or key secret is only `configured: true|false`.
- The routes are admin scope only (not in `CLIENT_ALLOW`) and answer 403
  `identity_perspicax` on an organization server.
- `POST /api/mail/test` takes no fields, sends only to the caller's own
  address and is rate limited.
- Saved values live in `config.json`'s `mail` block through `saveConfig`
  (never a generic `PUT /api/config` patch) and win over `OMB_MAIL_*`, which
  only provides defaults.
- A sender always has a name (default `Sagax`); Twilio refuses one without.
- Tests and fixtures use fake credentials only.

## Profile on an organization server

On an organization server (`OMB_IDENTITY=perspicax`) a signed-in person's
name and email belong to Perspicax. Keep these rules, each covered by a test
in `server/member-identity.e2e.test.ts`, `server/org-identity.e2e.test.ts`,
`server/org-profile.e2e.test.ts`, `server/oidc-login.test.ts` or the
onboarding tests:

- `GET /api/auth/session` and the config's `viewer` carry
  `profileManagedBy: "perspicax"` and `profileManageUrl` (the issuer's
  `/console/me`) for every session; never on a solo server or for the
  operator at the server's own console (loopback).
- `PUT`/`PATCH /api/config` with `profile.name` or `profile.email` answers
  403 `identity_perspicax` for those sessions. About me and the rest of the
  config stay as they were.
- The name and email come from the id_token and the directory and are
  refreshed at each sign-in and token refresh (`PrincipalRegistry.forSubject`).
- The UI follows the server's answer (`src/lib/profile-management.ts`): the
  welcome greeting asks for nothing and Settings > General shows the identity
  read-only ("Géré par votre organisation (Pulsatrix Perspicax)", "Modifier
  dans Perspicax"). A change here needs the server image redeployed.
- A person reads as `personDisplayName` (`server/viewer-identity.ts`): the
  Perspicax display name, else the address's local part, else the login; a
  directory name equal to the login is not a display name.
- Avatar (`server/org-profile.e2e.test.ts`): Sagax keeps only a version
  (`Principal.avatar`) from the id_token `picture` claim (a URL on the
  issuer's origin with `?v=<version>`) or the directory's `avatar`
  (null removes it), reads the PNG or JPEG through the link
  (`GET /api/v1/pulsabot/people/<sub>/avatar`, Bearer link token) and serves
  it at `/api/people/<principalId>/avatar?v=<version>`. Without those
  Perspicax fields everyone keeps their initials.

## Launch flow (desktop)

First run on the desktop app's own window opens the launch screen
(`src/components/onboarding/LaunchScreen.tsx`, rules in `src/lib/launch.ts`)
before the welcome tour: **No server** is the solo app, **Server**
probes the address (`orgJoin.probe`, Perspicax-linked servers only) then
`orgJoin.join` saves the server and starts the existing **Sign in with
Pulsatrix** (`electron/org-join.mjs`, `startPulsatrixSignIn` in
`electron/main.mjs`). Do not add another sign-in path. The choice lives in
`config.onboarding.launchMode`; the default address is
`DEFAULT_SERVER_ADDRESS`, overridable at build time with
`SAGAX_DEFAULT_SERVER`. The welcome tour no longer surfaces the inherited
managed-desktop Admin sign-in; Settings > Organization still does. See
`docs/self-hosting.md` ("At launch: No server or Server").

Server mode (the launch screen's Server) is exclusive: `serverModeId` in
`environments.json` (`electron/environments.cjs`) locks the app to that
organization server. While it is set nothing switches to Local or another
server (`withActive`, `switchEnvironment`, `requireNotServerMode`), the
packaged app starts no local server, and the only way out is `leaveServerMode`
in `electron/main.mjs` (Settings > General > Server > Change, Server > Change
server…), which signs out and returns to the launch screen. Tests:
`electron/server-mode.node-test.mjs`, `electron/environments.node-test.mjs`.

An organization server (`org: true`, set by org-join after its probe) is
drawn with this app's own bundle (`electron/bundled-ui.cjs`): page requests
come from the bundle, `/api/`, `/.well-known/` and `/auth/` pass through.
Keep these rules: the session cookie rides only with the bundled page's own
requests (its referrer is the server's origin), never a widget's or another
origin's; main's own calls to a server pass `bypassCustomProtocolHandlers`;
the bundled page gets only `BUNDLED_EXTRA` in `electron/preload.cjs`, and
main checks those channels with `desktopUiOnly` (`electron/local-origin.cjs`);
anything touching this computer stays `localOnly`. Tests:
`electron/bundled-ui.node-test.mjs`; real Electron:
`scripts/verify-server-mode.ts`.

On an organization server (`OMB_IDENTITY=perspicax`) bots never use the
server's own machine: `ManagedDesktopPolicy` refuses `thisComputer` and
`localVm` there (`HOST_COMPUTER_REFUSAL`, every claim passes
`bindTurnComputer`), and the Local VM create/start routes refuse with
`hostComputerRefusal()`. A bot reaches the computer of the person who asks
through `server/user-computers.ts`: `speakingPerson` (a person's message or a
hop carrying it; never a routine), then a provider per target
(`user-desktop`: that person's desktop app via the owner-scoped `SharedComputers`
`list(person)` and `request`, for the person `sharedComputerPrincipal` proves; `user-sandbox`: plugs in as a second provider). Not connected, not
theirs, or no person: the tool answers why. `shared_computer` is never
pre-allowed for Claude (`agentsAllowedTools`), so the bot's approval mode
applies. Tests: `server/user-computers.test.ts`,
`electron/server-mode.node-test.mjs`.

A person's preferences on an organization server live per principal
(`shared/user-preferences.ts` lists the only keys that travel,
`server/user-preferences.ts`, `GET/PUT /api/me/preferences`). The renderer
syncs them before the app draws (`src/lib/user-preferences-sync.ts`); the
launch screen hands this computer's own values over once at join
(`orgJoin.join({ preferences })`, `takePreferences`). Device-only state
(drafts, sizes, floating list and positions, mood, voices) never travels.

## Model picker

The model chip (composer and chat header, `src/components/ModelPicker.tsx`)
opens a modal like Settings, portalled to `<body>`: providers with their
status on the left, account, scope, models, effort and payers on the right,
a bottom sheet on a narrow window; focus stays inside and Escape closes it.
Only `contained` (the bot settings dialog) keeps the inline panel. On an
organization server it shows the speaker's payer order
(`src/lib/model-payers.ts`: subscription, key in Perspicax, organization
key, as `server/engine-credentials.ts` decides; the payer used now is the
server's `myTurns`, never recomputed; a routine thread shows the owner's
credentials) and signs in their own subscription through `/api/me/engines/<id>/login`
(`ModelPickerPayers.tsx`), never the server's engine login; the server's
local models are not offered. Tests: `ModelPicker.interaction.test.ts`,
`src/lib/model-payers.test.ts`; real Electron: `scripts/verify-server-mode.ts`
(org) and `pnpm exec electron scripts/smoke-approval-modes.cjs --model-ui-only`
(solo).

## Floating bots and the desktop mascot

A bot put "on the desktop" stands in its own transparent window
(`electron/floating-bot-window.mjs`). The main app page stays the brain
(`src/components/floating-bots/FloatingBots.tsx`, `brain.ts`): it sends each
window a validated snapshot (pose, balloon, `task`, `mood`, `flyAway`,
`liveliness`, `context`, `mascot` (the bot's look), `hints`) and receives clicks,
typed text, `play`, `pet` and `mascot` events. Keep it that way: a floating
window holds no session and calls no API. Changes under `electron/` need an
Electron restart (no HMR); launch-test them before committing.

- `clips.ts` holds every animation clip as a pure function of time;
  `behavior.ts` is the state machine that picks them (scheduler.ts for idle
  actions, with cooldowns and the activity level) and cross-fades them.
  Nothing moves faster than about 4 Hz; reactions keep a minimum dwell.
  Test new behavior there, not in the view.
- Characters live in the registry `mascots.tsx` (id, label, thumbnail,
  renderer, capabilities, popover paint and moves); adding one is adding an
  entry. Flat renderers (`Owl25D.tsx` draws owl-art's own SVG parts) never
  turn in depth: only `depth` renderers spin, flip or turn in place.
- The 3D owl (`owl3d/Owl3D.tsx`, preview, off by default) is a modeled,
  rigged and animated glb (original work, see NOTICE) built headless in
  Blender by `tools/owl3d/build_owl.py` and compressed by `pnpm gen:owl3d`
  (`tools/owl3d/gen.mjs`; Blender from `brew install --cask blender` or
  `BLENDER=`). One material per palette region (named after the palette
  slot), shape keys for the lids and beak, 24 clips in place.
  `OWL_CLIP_FOR` maps every behavior activity to a clip; the gaze and blink
  are an overlay undone after each frame (never accumulated). Add
  `--render DIR` to the generator for Eevee preview sheets, and check it in
  real Electron with `node scripts/verify-owl3d.mjs [dir]` (isolated: own
  Vite port, temporary profile). Keep it lazy so the main bundle never loads
  three; `src/lib/floating-bots.test.ts` guards this.
- `fit.ts` sizes the stage for the widest pose; `pilot.ts` moves the window
  (flights, walks) through `floating-bots:geometry`, `move-to` and
  `autopilot`; main clamps every move and never saves spots flown to.
- Main retries a page that fails to load, reloads a dead or silent one, keeps
  a state sent before its window exists, and logs the page's errors; the
  window falls back to the plain owl rather than drawing nothing.
- The character (owl, original shape, Trombi) and its look live with the bot
  (`bot.mascotLook`, `shared/mascot-look.ts`, validated by the server), chosen
  in the avatar popover (`MascotLookEditor.tsx`) and drawn by `BotAvatar` for
  every bot avatar in the app; never draw a bot's mascot outside `BotAvatar`.
- Per device:, the mood (`omb.floatingBots.mood.v1`, never punishing),
  and the settings "Fly away during tasks" and "Activity level"
  (`omb.floatingBots.prefs.v1`, Settings > Appearance and the right-click
  menu). The bar under the mascot is the thread's context, from the chat
  header's own figures. User docs: `apps/docs/content/docs/features/floating-bots.mdx`.

## Sign in with Pulsatrix (desktop)

The desktop app always signs in through the system browser, never in a
window of its own (passkeys and password managers live in the browser).
`startPulsatrixSignIn` in `electron/main.mjs` and
`electron/oidc-system-sign-in.cjs` own it; there is no in-app sign-in
window, do not add one back. Return paths, in order: a one-shot loopback
listener on `127.0.0.1` (ephemeral port, random state path, exact Host and
Origin, ten-minute timeout, closed after use), then `openmausbot://auth` only
when this exact running copy owns the scheme and the server advertises
`nativeReturn`, else an error on `/pair`. The server side is
`validLoopbackReturn` in `server/oidc-login.ts` (loopback IP literals with a
port and a state only; the credential rides in the fragment) and the
descriptor's `identity.loopbackReturn`. Tests:
`electron/oidc-system-sign-in.node-test.mjs`, `server/oidc-login.test.ts`,
`server/oidc-session.e2e.test.ts` (S2-7b). The return lands in the main window as
`<origin>/pair?signin=<nonce>#code=...` (`authReturnTarget`): never a
fragment-only change of the `/pair` the window already shows, which would
not reload the page. `scripts/verify-desktop-sign-in.ts` proves it in a real
Electron window. A change to that server code needs the server image
redeployed.

## Server environments (organization mode)

On an organization server, bots run shell, file and browser tools in a
person's server environment (`user-sandbox`): the SPEAKER's for a
conversation, the bot OWNER's for routines, the asker's or else the room
creator's in a room (`sandboxPrincipalForTurn`). One isolated container per
person, never per bot, never on the Sagax host (`docs/user-sandbox.md`).
Keep these rules, each covered by `server/user-sandbox*.test.ts`,
`server/sandboxd*.test.ts` or `server/user-sandbox.e2e.test.ts`:

- Only `sagax-sandboxd` (`server/sandboxd.ts`) holds the Docker socket; the
  Sagax server calls it with signed requests (`server/sandboxd-auth.ts`).
- The provisioner API is keyed by person (`sandboxKeyForPrincipal`); never add
  a bot parameter. Every create body passes `assertSandboxIsolation()`.
- Engines get no shell, file or fetch tool of their own there
  (`withholdHostTools`, `server/drivers/host-tools.ts`); an engine that
  cannot withhold them is refused. `scripts/smoke-host-tools.ts` checks the
  real Claude Code CLI.
- Server code runs under `--experimental-strip-types`: no TypeScript
  parameter properties in these files.
- `scripts/smoke-user-sandbox.ts` proves isolation on a real Docker host and
  removes everything it creates.

## Desktop bridge (organization mode)

In server mode the desktop app is the bridge between the organization server
and the person's PC (`electron/desktop-bridge.mjs`, `electron/desktop-tunnel.mjs`,
`server/desktop-bridge*.ts`, `server/desktop-egress.ts`). Bots working for a
person run the solo-mode tools on that person's own computer, as the MCP
server `sagax-desktop` (shell, files, search, fetch, offscreen browser,
computer use, Local VM), and the engine's own network traffic leaves through
it. Keep these rules, each covered by `server/desktop-bridge*.test.ts`,
`server/desktop-egress.test.ts`, `server/attachment-staging.test.ts`,
`electron/desktop-bridge.node-test.mjs` or `scripts/verify-desktop-bridge.ts`:

- Where tools run is decided once per turn by `resolveBotWorkplace`: the
  speaker's desktop when it is connected and their preference
  (`sagax.botWorkplace.v1`, Settings > Organization > Where bots work) is
  "computer" (the default); else their server environment, and the bot and
  the composer say so. Routines use the owner's desktop only when it is
  connected AND the owner allowed it (off by default). Rooms: the person
  whose message triggered the turn; a follow-up nobody asked for never.
- A bridge is bound to the person of the session that registered it and to
  a secret only the desktop's main process holds; every poll, result and the
  tunnel re-check that the session is live and still that person. A turn's
  capability names the person at mount; the hub reaches only that person's
  own desktop. The server host is never a target; engine host tools stay
  denied (`withholdHostTools`); `sagax-desktop` tools are never pre-allowed.
- Egress: an HTTP(S) proxy on 127.0.0.1 with a per-thread credential, valid
  only while that thread runs a turn for that person on their computer
  (`turnNetworkProxy`); the drivers set HTTP(S)_PROXY with NO_PROXY for the
  model hosts. The desktop opens each connection itself, through the OS proxy
  and VPN, refuses its own loopback and link-local, and applies "local network
  only". Destinations (host:port only) go to `desktop-bridge-audit.jsonl` and
  the desktop's own activity log.
- Attachments of the CURRENT message are the speaker's only when the first
  message naming them is theirs; small text ones are inlined, all are copied
  where the tools run at the first tool call, and the tag names that path.
- The desktop never reads or writes the app's own data, its cookies or the
  person's credential stores through the bridge.

A change under `server/` needs the server image redeployed; under `electron/`
a desktop rebuild.

## Connectors from the person's own Claude account

Sagax builds no GitHub, Outlook or Calendar integration of its own: a Claude
turn keeps the claude.ai connectors (Microsoft 365, GitHub, Gmail, ...) of
the account it runs on when that account is the speaker's own
(`server/harness-connectors.ts`, rules in `claudeAiConnectorsForTurn`). Keep
these rules, each covered by `server/harness-connectors.test.ts` or
`server/drivers/claude.test.ts`:

- Organization server: only an access `via: "subscription"` (the owner
  speaking, from their own login directory). Owner key, org key and server
  turns get none. Solo server: the operator and the operator's routines only.
- The Claude driver drops `--strict-mcp-config` for such a turn (it also
  drops claude.ai connectors, measured on CLI 2.1.287) and keeps
  `--setting-sources project`; every other isolated turn sets
  `ENABLE_CLAUDEAI_MCP_SERVERS=false`.
- Connector tools (`mcp__claude_ai_*`) are never pre-allowed: they ride the
  approval flow. An engine tool denial blocks host built-ins, never them.
- Connected apps shows them read-only (`GET /api/me/harness-connectors`, the
  caller's own account only, no email or URL) with a link to
  claude.ai/customize/connectors; an admin turns them off with
  `PUT /api/harness-connectors/settings` (`config.harnessConnectors.claudeAi`).
- Codex: ChatGPT connectors need Codex's own ChatGPT login, which Sagax's
  ChatGPT plan mode and API keys do not have, so Codex turns get none.

## Upstream sync

Last sync: 2026-10-01, upstream `milind-soni/OpenMausBot` main at
`4ed952aa` (0.1.92) merged into Sagax; `baseVersion` follows it. To repeat:

- Keep the `upstream` remote fetch-only (`git remote set-url --push
  upstream no_push`). Never push, open a pull request or file an issue
  upstream.
- `git fetch upstream`, branch from `origin/main`, then `git merge
  upstream/main` (a real merge, never a rebase) so history stays traceable.
- On conflict our behavior wins and upstream improvements are layered in.
  Merge `src/locales/*.json` and `source-hashes.json` as a union of keys and
  run `pnpm i18n:check`.
- Run `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, typecheck, lint, the unit suites and
  `pnpm build`; compare failures with `origin/main` before pushing to
  `origin` only.
- MCP sign-in is ours (`server/mcp-oauth.ts`, vault `mcp-oauth.enc` and
  `mcp-oauth.key`, both left out of workspace backups). Upstream's own
  MCP sign-in manager and routes were not taken.
